https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65670259/every-python-related-executable-broken-fatal-python-error-init-import-size-f

While trying to find the problem, I soon realized that it was not special to my command. In fact, all python-related executables produce the same error when invoked from any command prompt, no matter where I am in my filesystem. python, python3, anaconda (and its prompt), conda, pip, pip3, ... All of these suddenly don't work anymore. They all fail with the same error message, only the thread is altering.

In my research I found a very similar error very often, but it was about the encodings module. Also I haven't read about issues where the entire python ecosystem just broke.

Solutions to said similar error seem to include doing something with the PYTHONPATH and PYTHONHOME envs if they exist. But I don't have them, neither as user variable nor as system var.

/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:
/usr/local/lib/python3/dist-packages:
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:
/usr/local/lib/python3/dist-packages:

SOLUTION
===========================================================
unset PYTHONPATH   ## THE BEST

## export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python3/dist-packages:$PYTHONPATH
## export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:$PYTHONPATH

## export PYTHONPATH=/home/wruslan/PycharmProjects/test-01/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
## export PYTHONPATH=/home/wruslan/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
## export PYTHONPATH=/home/wruslan/opt/GNAT/2020/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
